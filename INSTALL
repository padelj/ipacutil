To install ipacutil:

0) You will need libusb-dev installed.  On Ubuntu, type:
	sudo apt-get install libusb-dev

1) edit the Makefile as necessary.  You probably don't have to touch it.  Note that
   only USB is supported (not PS/2)

2) make

3) make install

You may be able to run "ipacutil --detect" to see if it sees your I-PAC.  However, even if
it is not properly detected, it can probably be programmed.  Newer models do not have the detection
logic.
